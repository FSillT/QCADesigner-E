<h2>Installation</h2>
These instructions should guide you through he installation procedure.

<h3>Under Microsoft Windows</h3>

      <p>In order to run <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> under Microsoft Windows 
        you will require an extra package called GTK+. Download and install the 
        GTK Runtime Environment from <a href="http://dropline.net/gtk">http://dropline.net/gtk</a>. 
        Once you have installed the runtime environment download the <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> 
        self-extracting executable from the <a href="http://www.qcadesigner.ca/download.html"> download 
        page</a> and install it. This should be all you will require to run <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> 
        under Windows. 
      <h3>RPM Based Systems</h3>
<p>Note: you will require the root password. 

      <p>Download the RPM version of <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> for your 
        particular architecture from the <a href="http://www.qcadesigner.ca/download.html">download 
        page</a>. Login as root and go to the directory where the downloaded RPM 
        is located. To install the RPM type: 
      <p><i>rpm -Uhv QCADesigner[version you downloaded].rpm</i> 

      <p>That should be all you need. Now run <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> 
        with the command 
      <p><i>QCADesigner</i>

<p>If for any reason the binary RPMs fail to install on your system, you can produce your own binary RPMs from the source RPM available on the <a href="http://www.qcadesigner.ca/download.html">download page</a>.  First, download the source RPM (QCADesigner-&lt;version&gt;-1.src.rpm).  Then, as root, type

<p><i>rpmbuild --rebuild QCADesigner-&lt;version&gt;-1.src.rpm</i>

<p>This will create binary RPMs under /usr/src/redhat/RPMS.  Look for them there.  Their file names will be of the form QCADesigner-&lt;version&gt;-1.&lt;arch&gt;.rpm.


<a name="source">
<h3>From Source</h3>
<p>Download the source from the <a href="http://www.qcadesigner.ca/download.html">download page</a>. Extract the package to a known directory by typing

<p><i>tar -xzvf QCADesigner[version you downloaded].tar.gz</i> &larr; For tar.gz sources.
<p><i>tar -xjvf QCADesigner[version you downloaded].tar.bz2</i> &larr; For tar.bz2 sources.

<p>Switch to the new directory:

<p><i>cd QCADesigner[version you downloaded]</i>

<p>Prepare the program for compiling by typing 

<p><i>./autogen.sh</i>

<p>Next, you have to run the <i>configure</i> script to customize the compilation process for
   your system. The <i>configure</i> script provides many options. The most commonly used one
   is <i>--prefix=[directory]</i>, where <i>directory</i> is the directory where you would
   like to install <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong>. Once installed, the
   <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> program will be at <i>directory/bin/QCADesigner</i>.
   For example:</p>

<p><i> ./configure --prefix=/home/your_account/your_install_location</i>

<p>Type <i>./configure --help</i> for a complete list of <i>configure</i> options.

<p>Compile the program with

<p><i>make</i>

<p>Install the program with 

<p><i>make install</i>

      <p>Run <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> with 
      <p><i>QCADesigner &amp;</i>

<p>Voila!

<h3>Under Mac OS X</h3>
      <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong> will run under Mac OS X, however, you will 
      require several other packages to do this. Basically, these packages will 
      allow you to run Unix applications on you Mac. First you will need to install 
      <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net">Fink</a>. When, within Fink, you choose the packages 
      you would like installed, make sure to include the package GTK+. You will also require the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">X11 
      server</a>. Once you have these packages you should be able to download 
      and install <strong>QCA<em>Designer</em></strong><a href="#source"> from 
      source</a>. Sorry that this is not a step-by-step guide, but fink is constantly 
      evolving, so I could end up leading you down the wrong path. You should 
      read the installation instructions carefully on the Fink site.
