Quickstart
========

The QCADesigner-E is an extension of the QCADesigner (version 2.0.3) [1] and has been developed at the University of Bremen. The tool, which has been presented in [2] (https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2018.2789782), implements the estimation of the power dissipation of QCA circuits based on the works of Timler and Lent et al. [3-5]. The extension is integrated as an additional simulation module that is based on the Coherence Vector Simulation Engine (CVSE). Further, The QCADesigner-E  is fully compatible to QCA designs generated with the QCADesigner version 2.0.3.

QCADesigner-E is free to use and to modify. However, you must add following references in case of any publication:

Installation
============
Switch to source folder of the project:

```sh
$ cd QCADesignerE
```

Prepare the program for compiling by typing

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
```

Next, you have to run the configure script to customize the compilation process for your system. The configure script provides many options. The most commonly used one is --prefix=[directory], where directory is the directory where you would like to install QCADesignerE. Once installed, the QCADesignerE program will be at QCADesignerE/bin/QCADesignerE. For example:

```sh
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/your_account/your_install_location
```

Type ./configure --help for a complete list of configure options.

Compile the program with

```sh
$ make
```
Install the program with

```sh
$ make install
```
Run QCADesignerE with

```sh
$ bin\QCADesigner &
```
