<h2>Manipulating Objects</h2>

      <p>You can select objects on any active layer.</p>
      <p><a name="selecting_objects"></a>You can select a single object by left-clicking on it.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>You can select any group of objects by left-clicking on the workspace and 
        dragging the mouse to create a selection rectangle. The objects contained 
        in that selection rectangle will be hilighted in <font color="#FF0000">red</font>. 
        There are many things you can do with a selection: </p>
      <hr>
You can add objects to your selection by holding down <b>Shift</b> and creating a 
selection rectangle, as above.  Deselected objects in the rectangle will be selected.

<hr>
You can remove objects from your selection by holding down <b>Ctrl</b> and creating a
selection rectangle.  Selected objects in the rectangle will be deselected.
<hr>
You can create a copy of your selection by clicking "Copy" 
<img src="images/copy_button.png" alt="[Copy]" align="absmiddle">. A copy of the selected objects
will be created, unless your current selection cannot be dropped.
If the location where you want to place the copy is off-screen, you 
can use the mouse wheel to scroll there. Alone, the mouse wheel scrolls the 
workspace up&larr;&rarr;down.  To scroll left&larr;&rarr;right, hold down <b>Ctrl</b> 
while scrolling.
<hr>
To mirror a selection of objects, first select the objects you would like to mirror.
Then, click "Mirror" <img src="images/mirror_button.png" align="absmiddle" alt="[Mirror]">. From
the menu that pops up, choose either "Horizontally", if you want to mirror
across the <i>x</i>-axis, or "Vertically", if you want to mirror across the
<i>y</i>-axis.
<hr>
To rotate a block of objects by 90&deg;, first make a selection, then click
"Tools&rarr;Rotate Selection":
      <p align="center"> <img src="images/rotate_selection_menu.png" align="absmiddle" alt="Main Menu:Tools->Rotate Selection"> 
      <p>
Your selection will be rotated 90&deg;.  Click the menu item again and again to 
rotate by 180&deg; and 270&deg;, respectively.
<p>
<b>TIP:</b> To rotate a copy of your selection, first make a selection, click
"Copy", then click "Tools&rarr;Rotate Selection".
<p>
<hr>
      To delete a selection of objects, first <a href="#selecting_objects">make such
      a selection</a>. Then press the "Delete" key to delete your selection.
<hr>
  When you drag a selection and your objects are snapped to the grid, you
  cannot move those objects around arbitrarily. However, by choosing <img align="absmiddle" src="images/translate_button.png" alt="[Translate]">,
  you can move a selection by an arbitrary number of nanometers.
<hr>
  <p>To accomodate multilayer circuits, it is now possible to change the
     appearance of cells. This does not affect their simulated behaviour. It is
     merely a means of visually identifying cells overlapping on different
     layers. To modify the appearance of selected cells, click <img src="images/alt_style_button.png" alt="Alternate style" align="absmiddle">
     and choose from among 3 appearances from the popup menu.</p>
 <p><b>TIP:</b> In the cell libraries, we observe the following convention:
    <ol>
    <li>Cells on the main layer are left unaltered, except for those underlying "via" cells.</li>
    <li>Cells on "via" layers and those accessing "via" layers are drawn using the circular appearance.</li>
    <li>Cells on "crossover" layers are drawn using the "X" appearance, except those accessing "via" layers.</li>
    </ol>
    This creates crossovers according to the following convention:</p>
