ChangeLog for next release -- 1.3.

Completed Changes/Bug Fixes/Additions:

    structures
 -- Created new user interface for specifying vector tables
 -- Added basic Undo/Redo capabilities for creating cells
 -- Fixed clipping bug occurring with toolbar pixmaps
 -- Rotate cells now can rotate all selected cells if they are selected prior
    to pushing the rotate button.
