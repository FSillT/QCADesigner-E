# QCADesigner-E
The QCADesigner-E is an extension of the QCADesigner (version 2.0.3) [1] and has been developed at the University of Bremen. The tool, which has been presented in [2], implements the estimation of the power dissipation of QCA circuits based on the works of Timler and Lent et al. [3-5]. The extension is integrated as an additional simulation module that is based on the Coherence Vector Simulation Engine (CVSE). Further, The QCADesigner-E  is fully compatible to QCA designs generated with the QCADesigner version 2.0.3.

QCADesigner-E is free to use and to modify. However, you must add following references in case of any publication:
